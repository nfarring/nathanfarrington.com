    The OIDA and the Ethernet Alliance organized a workshop to study
    100 Gigabit Ethernet over a single wavelength, for the data
    center market. In my opinion, it is much too early to be worried
    about this.

    This paper proposes a new scheduling algorithm for fast,
    microsecond-scale data center circuit switches, called traffic
    matrix scheduling. An advantage of traffic matrix scheduling
    over the previous hotspot scheduling is that more traffic can be
    offloaded to the circuit-switched portion of the data center
    network, making circuit switches much more useful than
    previously thought.

    One weakness of the Helios paper is that the relatively long
    switching time of 30ms limited the usefulness of the resulting
    hybrid network. So we developed our own optical circuit switch
    that is 1,000x faster than Helios. We demonstrated our switch at
    the SIGCOMM conference.

    While working on the Helios project, we discovered that many of
    the optical communication devices commonly used in data center
    networks, such as electronic dispersion compensators (EDC) and
    transimpedence amplifiers (TIA), are not optimized for quickly
    recovering after a loss of light. However, we did find that such
    technology exists and future data center networks could be
    engineered for high performance when using optical circuit
    switches.

    Traditionally, local area networks, including data center
    networks, have been constructed using switched Ethernet. A
    typical 10G Ethernet switch uses 12.5W per port, and cost
    upwards of $500 per port or more. There is a cheaper source of
    bandwidth: optical circuit switching. This paper describes how
    we constructed a data center network using an optical circuit
    switch and what we had to do to achieve good performance.

| **Data Center Switch Architecture in the Age of Merchant Silicon**
| Nathan Farrington, Erik Rubow, and Amin Vahdat
| `IEEE Symposium on High-Performance
  Interconnects <http://www.hoti.org/>`__, New York, August 2009

    One of the primary reasons for low server utilization in data
    centers is that the data center network is oversubscribed
    (underprovisioned). This is necessary due to the non-commodity
    (super-expensive) nature of current commercial data center
    switches. This paper describes how to construct a 3,456-port 10G
    Ethernet switch out of "merchant silicon", i.e. switch chips
    designed for low-end commodity Ethernet switches. It is likely
    that future data center networks will be constructed almost
    entirely from merchant silicon, just as modern data center
    servers contain commodity Intel or AMD processors.

| **PortLand: A Scalable Fault-Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network
  Fabric**
| Radhika Niranjan Mysore, Andreas Pamboris, Nathan Farrington,

  Subramanya, and Amin Vahdat

    Both Layer 2 Ethernet forwarding (learning bridge, minimum
    spanning tree, broadcast) and Layer 3 IP routing (longest-prefix
    matching, routing protocols) have problems scaling to large
    numbers of servers in the data center. This paper describes a
    new forwarding mechanism called PortLand designed specifically
    for data centers with much better scaling properties than either
    traditional Layer 2 or Layer 3 forwarding. Now, at least from a
    network address viewpoint, it is possible to treat all hosts in
    a data center as interchangeable components. Additionally, a
    PortLand network will never contain a forwarding loop.

| **Multipath TCP under MASSIVE Packet Reordering**
| Nathan Farrington
| UC San Diego Tech Report, June 2009
| (`PDF </papers/multipath-tcp-techreport09.pdf>`__)
  (`Slides </presentations/multipath-tcp-techreport09-slides.pptx>`__)

    This was my "Research Exam", an in-depth survey of a specific
    area leading to a Masters degree. I have always been fascinated
    by how simultaneously good and bad TCP is across a wide range of
    networks and communication patterns. One design feature of TCP
    is that duplicate acknowledgements are used as an early
    indicator of packet loss, and hence an early indicator of
    congestion. Unfortunately, packet reordering will cause the
    receiver to transmit duplicate acknowledgements, fooling the
    sender into thinking that the network in congested. This limits
    opportunities for parallelism in data center networks, which by
    design have multiple paths between hosts for both increased
    capacity and fault tolerance. This report looks at historical
    approaches for fixing TCP so that eventually we will be able to
    fully utilize multipath data center networks.
